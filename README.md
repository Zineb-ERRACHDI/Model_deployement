# Model Deployment Project

This repository contains a machine learning model deployment using Flask. The primary objective of the project is to deploy a pre-trained Random Forest model (random_forest_model.pkl) as a web service, allowing users to interact with the model via HTTP requests.<br>
The deployment leverages Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to serve the machine learning model as an API. Users can send data to the model and receive predictions in real-time.
